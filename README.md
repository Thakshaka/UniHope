# UniHope Personalized State University Course Recommendation and Cutoff Prediction SaaS

## Overview

UniHope is an innovative AI-powered platform designed to assist Sri Lankan G.C.E Advanced Level students in their state university course selection process. UniHope analyzes students' academic profiles to provide personalized course recommendations, helping them make informed decisions about their higher education journey. UniHope's user-friendly interface and multi-language support ensure accessibility for all, while its advanced algorithms offer up-to-date insights on state university course cutoff predictions. At UniHope, we're committed to simplifying students' paths to the right state university course and empowering their academic future.

## Background & Research

UniHope aims to tackle an important issue that almost every Sri Lankan G.C.E Advanced Level student faces after they receive their exam results. The idea for this project came to us when we remembered how difficult it was to select a set of courses that is eligible for our subjects stream and also possible given our Z score. We felt that there was a real need for an efficient and innovative solution, and that's what we set out to build.

## Current Challenges

We noticed that around 300,000 students participate in G.C.E Advanced Level Examination per year, and more than half of them become eligible to enter state universities. However, most students face recurring issues in navigating the university admission handbook provided by the University Grants Commission in Sri Lanka. The process is time-consuming, often confusing, and particularly challenging for students with lower Z scores who frequently miss out on eligible courses due to lack of awareness and the handbook's complexity. It's not just about choosing courses; it's about making life-changing decisions under pressure, often without proper guidance or tools to help them understand their full range of opportunities.
Research Findings
Our research across social media platforms revealed thousands of students expressing their concerns about university admissions. From YouTube channels to Facebook pages, we analyzed these comments and identified four critical questions that students repeatedly ask every year:

1. "I studied Mathematics for A/Ls and my Z-score is 1.6550. Will I be able to get into an engineering course this year?"
2. "I completed A/Ls in the Arts stream with a Z-score of 0.1550. Can I qualify for any state university?"
3. "Which courses are available for my stream?"
4. "I missed my chance at university entrance because I wasn't aware of courses that matched my Z-score and stream."

## Solution Development

To address these challenges, we developed UniHope to automate this complex process. UniHope includes a machine learning model trained to predict cutoff Z scores for the upcoming year by analyzing historical data up to 10+ years and filtering out suitable courses for each student. What sets UniHope apart is its innovative approach to digitizing a complex manual task through modern technologies, ensuring a more effective and efficient solution. By developing UniHope, we aim to solve this long-standing problem for students and empower them to make informed decisions quickly and confidently, saving them time and reducing stress during a critical phase of their lives.
